Analyzing demographics data to identify potention customers within the general population

## Motivation

A mail-order company in Germany is looking into expanding their customer base. The best way to acquire new customers is by launching a targeted marketing campaign wherein specific individuals who are more likely to become customers are targeted with advertisements. The company requires identification of these 'potential customers' within the general population. Arvato Financial Solutions has tasked me with analyzing demographics data for both the mail-order company's customer base and the general population at large to identify parts of the population that best describe the core customer base of the company.
